# Health Care Management System

## Description

The **Health Care Management System** is a web application that helps manage patient and employee records efficiently. The system allows users to navigate between different sections such as **Home**, **Login**, **Register Patient**, and **Register Employee**. The front-end of the system is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

This system serves as a basic framework for a real-world health care management application and will eventually allow users to:

- Log in to the system
- Register new patients
- Register new employees

Currently, the application focuses on the **interface design** and **basic functionality**, with placeholders for future logic implementation.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays the welcome message and an introduction to the system.
- **Navigation**: Provides links to different pages such as the Login, Register Patient, and Register Employee pages.
- **Forms**: Placeholder forms for logging in, registering patients, and registering employees. These forms are currently set to show an alert when submitted.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.
- **Basic Styling**: Includes simple styling using CSS for better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the pages and making them visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For handling form submission events (currently with placeholder alert messages).

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd healthcare-management-system
   ```

3. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor):

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**.

   Alternatively, you can use a local server like **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code to view the project live.

## Future Work

- **Backend Integration**: The login and registration forms will be connected to a backend database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store and retrieve user data.
- **Authentication**: Implement actual login functionality with secure authentication.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allow users to add, update, delete, and view patient and employee records.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and form validation for better user experience.
